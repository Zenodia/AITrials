# Image Recognition + Transfer Learning using ResNet

Deep [Convolutional Neural Networks](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/) have become the default choice for Image Recognition since [AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf).  One of the newer techniques for Image Recognition is to reuse an existing model (a.k.a. [Transfer Learning](http://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/)) as a starting point which can save a ton of time & resources needed to train a CNN from scratch. 

This repo contains a sample code walkthrough for this technique, which creates a custom CNN model using [Micrsoft ResNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385v1.pdf) to recognize two sets of images. For this example I have used baseball vs. cricket bats but you can replace this with any images (e.g. good product vs defected product, full shelf vs empty shelf, happy face vs sad faceâ€¦) and create your custom model. You many need to do some serious fine tuning or may be start from a different model but the core technique remains the same.
